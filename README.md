# Rock-Paper-Scissors-TOP

This is my first Javascript program as part of the TOP learning path. The goal will be to create rock paper scissors in the console and then eventually expand it to a webpage game. 

Update: This is the second iteration of the website that plays a simple game of rock, paper, scissors. The results of each cycle print to the screen after a user selects one of the buttons. Once a score of 5 is reach an alert is triggered and the score is reset.
